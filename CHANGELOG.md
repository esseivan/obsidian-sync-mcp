# Changelog

## 0.5.4

### Fixes
- Fix write corruption: `doNotUseFixedRevisionForChunks` was incorrectly hardcoded to `false`, causing chunk revision mismatches that made LiveSync clients report written files as corrupted. Now uses the library default (`true`), matching standard LiveSync configuration.
- Add `LIVESYNC_CHUNK_SIZE`, `LIVESYNC_MINIMUM_CHUNK_SIZE`, `LIVESYNC_HASH_ALG`, and `LIVESYNC_CHUNK_SPLITTER_VERSION` environment variables to let the MCP server's chunking parameters match the vault's LiveSync plugin settings exactly. Mismatch between these settings was the root cause of "file seems to be corrupted" errors after writes.

## 0.5.3

### Features
- New `READ_ONLY=true` env var disables write tools (`write_note`, `edit_note`, `delete_note`, `move_note`) — useful when exposing the server to multiple AI clients (#1, #3)

### Fixes
- Bump axios (1.13.6 → 1.16.0) and other transitive deps to clear high-severity npm audit advisories (SSRF, prototype pollution)

## 0.5.2

### Fixes
- Fix HKDF decryption error after Obsidian "Overwrite remote" rebuild — MCP was caching a stale PBKDF2 salt, causing notes written by MCP to be unreadable by the LiveSync plugin
- Clear encryption key cache before each write/delete to always use the current salt from CouchDB
- Add `E2EEAlgorithm: "v2"` to generated Setup URIs

## 0.5.1

### Features
- Setup script generates LiveSync Setup URIs (admin + livesync user) for one-paste Obsidian configuration
- Correct LiveSync client settings (chunk size, sync mode, obfuscation) baked into URI — prevents config mismatches between devices

### Fixes
- Add missing `[httpd] enable_cors = true` to CouchDB config (fixes mobile sync)
- Add `max_age = 3600` to CORS config

## 0.5.0

### Breaking Changes
- Remove `search_vault` tool and FlexSearch dependency — full-text search caused OOM on large encrypted vaults
- `list_notes` gains `name` parameter (case-insensitive substring match on path) as replacement for finding notes

### Changes
- Metadata index only: paths, mtimes, tags, links, backlinks (no full-text content indexing)
- Dramatically reduced memory usage — works on 512MB containers with any vault size
- Faster startup — no FlexSearch rebuild needed

## 0.4.10

### Fixes
- Remove Node.js heap cap (256MB too small for large encrypted vaults with FlexSearch)

## 0.4.9

### Fixes
- Start server before indexing — tools available immediately, search fills in progressively
- Fixes health check timeout loop on Fly.io with large vaults

## 0.4.8

### Fixes
- Stop persisting FlexSearch index (was 53MB, caused OOM on load). Only metadata persisted now.
- FlexSearch rebuilt from vault on every cold start
- Clear library chunk cache between catch-up batches
- Cap Node.js heap to 256MB in mcp-with-db deploy
- Remove stale entries from persisted metadata on filesystem restart

## 0.4.7

### Fixes
- Clear library chunk cache between batches during catch-up (prevents unbounded memory growth)
- Cap Node.js heap to 256MB in mcp-with-db deploy (leaves room for CouchDB in 512MB container)

## 0.4.6

### Fixes
- Skip non-markdown attachments during catch-up by decrypting path before fetching chunks
- Prevents loading large binary files (PDFs, images) into memory during initial index build

## 0.4.5

### Fixes
- Fix OOM crash on first startup with large vaults — paginate `_changes` catch-up in batches of 50
- Save index checkpoint after each batch so crashes resume from last progress, not from zero

## 0.4.4

### Changes
- Add `mcpName` field to package.json for MCP registry publishing

## 0.4.3

### Fixes
- Coerce `limit` and `include_snippets` params from string to number/boolean (Anthropic proxy sends all values as strings)
- Add tool call logging with args and execution time (`LOG_LEVEL=debug`)

## 0.4.2

### Features
- New `COUCHDB_OBFUSCATE_PROPERTIES` env var for vaults with "Obfuscate Properties" enabled in LiveSync
- Setup script asks about property obfuscation when passphrase is set

### Fixes
- Fix reading/writing notes in vaults with property obfuscation enabled (path obfuscation regression in livesync-commonlib service refactor)
- Suppress replicator service logs in production

## 0.4.1

### Fixes
- Catch decryption errors in CouchDB watcher instead of crashing (wrong passphrase skips the doc)
- Fix DirectFileManipulator initialization bugs in latest livesync-commonlib (addLog handler, settings, database service registration)
- Print version at startup for easier debugging
- Add global unhandled rejection handler as safety net
- Add Docker volume to README examples for index persistence

## 0.4.0

### Features
- New `edit_note` tool — append, prepend (after frontmatter), or replace exact text without rewriting the whole note
- New `list_folders` tool — lists all folders with note counts so the agent can discover folder names
- New `list_tags` tool — lists all tags with counts, sorted by frequency
- `list_notes` and `search_vault` now support `tag` filter parameter
- `get_note_metadata` now returns backlinks (notes that link to this one) for knowledge graph navigation
- `list_notes` now includes modification timestamps, `sort_by`, `modified_after`, and `limit` parameters
- `search_vault` now supports `modified_after` filter and optional `include_snippets`
- Agent can answer "read my latest note", "notes I changed today", "search only recent notes"

### Security
- Search index no longer stores note content on disk — only paths + mtimes persisted
- Persisted search metadata encrypted at rest when `COUCHDB_PASSPHRASE` is set (AES-256-GCM)
- Content snippets fetched on demand from vault, not cached
- E2E encryption no longer undermined by plaintext index on disk
- CouchDB vault rejects `..` and absolute paths (path traversal hardening)
- Block `javascript:`, `data:`, `file:` redirect URI schemes in OAuth registration
- Verify `client_id` at token exchange (defense-in-depth on top of PKCE)
- HTML-escape `code` and `csrf` values in OAuth form
- CSRF token rotated on each failed password attempt
- Validate `COUCHDB_DATABASE` name and LiveSync credentials in deploy entrypoint
- Validate auth token structure when loading from disk
- File watcher reads through vault.readNote() (symlink protection)
- Warn when server has no authentication and listens on all interfaces
- Require `COUCHDB_PASSWORD` in remote mode (no more default password)
- Periodic cleanup of expired tokens and unused OAuth clients
- Suppress password/passphrase echo in setup script, quote secrets for spaces
- `MCP_REFRESH_DAYS` falls back to default (14) when set to a non-numeric value
- Cap lockout backoff at ~85 minutes (prevents permanent lockout)

### Changes
- `search_vault` returns paths by default (not snippets) — set `include_snippets=true` for content
- Full search index (FlexSearch + metadata) persisted to disk and restored on cold start
- CouchDB mode uses `_changes` feed with persisted `since` for incremental startup (no full rebuild)
- Local mode uses mtime diff for incremental startup
- Survives Fly.io suspend/resume (in-memory) and cold restarts (disk)
- Backlinks are case-insensitive (matches Obsidian behavior)
- `.obsidian/` folder excluded from indexing and file watcher
- File watcher debounced (100ms per path) to coalesce rapid Obsidian saves
- `list_notes` default limit lowered from 500 to 100
- Improved tool descriptions with concrete examples for agents
- Suppress livesync-commonlib logs that expose file paths (`LOG_LEVEL=debug` to re-enable)
- Updated livesync-commonlib to latest upstream
- E2E tests rewritten in TypeScript with cold restart test

### Fixes
- `list_notes` and `search_vault` folder filter matches correctly without trailing slash
- CouchDB vault folder filter normalized to match local vault behavior
- `modified_after` returns clear error on invalid date format instead of empty results
- Guard against concurrent index saves
- Search snippets now work for multi-word queries where words aren't adjacent

## 0.3.0

- Restructured deploy into `deploy/mcp-only` and `deploy/mcp-with-db`
- Setup script asks which mode, vault name, and encryption passphrase
- MCP-only gets persistent volume (fixes auth state loss and 2-machine split)
- Single machine enforced on Fly.io (in-memory auth requires it)
- Shared IPv4 allocated by default (free instead of $2/month dedicated)
- README rewritten with decision table and three clear setup paths
- Agent instructions show deep links with visible URLs

## 0.2.2

### Fixes
- Add shebang to dist/main.js so `npx obsidian-sync-mcp` works
- Fix npm bin path normalization

## 0.2.0

### Features
- README rewrite: "Already have LiveSync?" as first-class path for 600k+ existing users
- Standalone MCP-only Fly.io deploy documented (no CouchDB needed)
- Multi-line YAML tag parsing (`tags:\n  - foo\n  - bar`)
- Deep link moved before note content (prevents link from polluting written notes)

### Refactoring
- Extracted VaultBackend interface to shared module with compile-time checks
- Extracted tools to separate tools.ts (main.ts reduced from 335 to 166 lines)
- Extracted extractSnippet() utility (was duplicated 3 times)
- Removed dead searchVault from both vault backends
- Fixed authenticate callback type (http.IncomingMessage instead of any)
- Fixed frontmatter type (Record<string, string> instead of any)

### Security
- Require redirect_uris at client registration (prevents open redirect)
- Validate registration payload sizes (5 URIs max, 256 char client names)
- HTML-escape error messages on OAuth password page
- Filter expired tokens on save and load
- Check auth code TTL at token exchange
- Fix CouchDB readiness check regex

### Fixes
- Fly.io app name no longer hardcoded (fly launch generates unique name)
- Deep links noted as client-dependent in Known Limitations

## 0.1.2

### Fixes
- Fly.io deployment: bind to 0.0.0.0 (was localhost-only, unreachable by Fly proxy)
- Fly.io deployment: CouchDB readiness check accepts 401 (auth-required means ready)
- Fly.io deployment: set COUCHDB_URL in entrypoint
- Fly.io deployment: use CouchDB base image (fixes missing libmozjs on amd64)
- Fly.io deployment: override ENTRYPOINT to avoid CouchDB entrypoint conflict
- CSP fix: removed form-action 'self' that blocked OAuth redirects in Claude's browser
- Persist data to Fly.io volume (DATA_DIR) — tokens and search index survive deploys
- Dockerfile.fly uses published ghcr.io image (no source build needed)
