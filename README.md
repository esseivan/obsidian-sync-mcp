Give any AI agent access to your Obsidian vault over MCP. Run it locally against your vault files, or pair it with [Self-hosted LiveSync](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync) and deploy to the cloud so it works even when your machine is off.

> **Example:** From your phone, ask your AI: "What's in my daily note for today?" — and get the full content back, with a link to open it in Obsidian.

---

## How it works

The server connects to your vault in two ways:

- **Filesystem mode** — reads `.md` files directly from your vault folder. No database needed.
- **CouchDB mode** — reads from a CouchDB database, locally or in the cloud. Your vault syncs to CouchDB via [Self-hosted LiveSync](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync), the community Obsidian plugin (600k+ downloads). The MCP server reads from CouchDB directly using [livesync-commonlib](https://github.com/vrtmrz/livesync-commonlib) — the same library that powers the plugin — for proper chunk handling and E2E encryption support.

Both modes expose the same MCP tools over HTTP, so any MCP-compatible agent can connect: Claude, Copilot, custom agents, anything that speaks the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

## Choose your setup

| Need it always available? | Have LiveSync? | Go to |
|---|---|---|
| Yes | Yes | [Setup A](#a-deploy-mcp-to-the-cloud) — add MCP alongside your existing CouchDB |
| Yes | No | [Setup B](#b-deploy-everything-to-the-cloud) — CouchDB + MCP + LiveSync from scratch |
| No | — | [Setup C](#c-run-on-your-machine) — filesystem or CouchDB, npx or Docker |

---

## A. Deploy MCP to the cloud

You already have LiveSync and CouchDB on an always-on server. You just need the MCP server deployed alongside it.

**Using Fly.io setup script** (macOS/Linux, or WSL on Windows):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/es617/obsidian-sync-mcp.git
cd obsidian-sync-mcp
./deploy/setup.sh    # choose option 2 (MCP only)
```

The script asks for your CouchDB connection details, vault name, and encryption passphrase.

**Or run the Docker image on any always-on server:**

```bash
docker run -p 8787:8787 \
  -v mcp-data:/data -e DATA_DIR=/data \
  -e COUCHDB_URL=https://your-couchdb:5984 \
  -e COUCHDB_USER=admin -e COUCHDB_PASSWORD=yourpassword \
  -e COUCHDB_DATABASE=obsidian -e VAULT_NAME=MyVault \
  -e COUCHDB_PASSPHRASE=your-encryption-passphrase \
  -e MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=yourpassword \
  -e BASE_URL=https://your-server-url \
  ghcr.io/es617/obsidian-sync-mcp:latest
```

Set `COUCHDB_PASSPHRASE` if you use E2E encryption in LiveSync. Set `BASE_URL` to your public URL (required for OAuth callbacks when agents connect over HTTPS).

Your MCP endpoint is `https://your-app.fly.dev/mcp` (Fly.io) or `https://your-server:8787/mcp` (Docker behind HTTPS).

See [Cost](#cost-flyio) for Fly.io pricing.

Requires [flyctl](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/install/) for the Fly.io path:

```bash
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh
export PATH="$HOME/.fly/bin:$PATH"  # add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
fly auth login
```

---

## B. Deploy everything to the cloud

Starting fresh — no LiveSync yet. Deploy CouchDB and MCP together, then set up LiveSync in Obsidian.

**Using Fly.io setup script** (macOS/Linux, or WSL on Windows):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/es617/obsidian-sync-mcp.git
cd obsidian-sync-mcp
./deploy/setup.sh    # choose option 1 (CouchDB + MCP)
```

The script generates credentials, creates the database, and deploys. Save the credentials it prints.

**Or with Docker Compose on any always-on server:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/es617/obsidian-sync-mcp.git
cd obsidian-sync-mcp

cat > .env <<EOF
COUCHDB_PASSWORD=changeme
VAULT_NAME=MyVault
EOF

docker compose up -d
```

**After deployment:**

1. In Obsidian, install [Self-hosted LiveSync](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync) and configure it with the credentials from the setup output
2. Your MCP endpoint is `https://your-app.fly.dev/mcp` (Fly.io) or `http://your-server:8787/mcp` (Docker)
3. The `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` is the password you enter when an agent connects

```
Always-on server
├── CouchDB + persistent storage
└── MCP server
      ↑                    ↑
Obsidian + LiveSync    AI agents
```

Requires [flyctl](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/install/) for the Fly.io path:

```bash
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh
export PATH="$HOME/.fly/bin:$PATH"  # add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
fly auth login
```

---

### Cost (Fly.io)

Applies to both Setup A and Setup B.

| Component | Cost |
|---|---|
| CouchDB + MCP VM (shared, 512MB) | ~$3-4/month (kept alive by LiveSync) |
| MCP-only VM (shared, 256MB) | ~$0-2/month (suspends when idle) |
| 1GB persistent volume | ~$0.15/month |

As of March 2026, Fly.io [may waive charges under $5/month](https://community.fly.io/t/bill-clarification-under-5-usd-of-usage-bill-charges-are-waived/26366), which could make this effectively free with a shared IPv4. Either way, cheaper than Obsidian Sync ($4/month) and you own the data.

---

## C. Run on your machine

Run the MCP server locally. Works with filesystem mode (reads vault files directly) or CouchDB mode (if you have LiveSync). Machine must stay on for agents to reach it.

**Filesystem mode (simplest):**

```bash
VAULT_PATH=~/Documents/MyVault \
VAULT_NAME=MyVault \
npx obsidian-sync-mcp
```

**CouchDB mode (if you have LiveSync):**

```bash
COUCHDB_URL=http://localhost:5984 \
COUCHDB_USER=admin \
COUCHDB_PASSWORD=yourpassword \
COUCHDB_DATABASE=obsidian \
COUCHDB_PASSPHRASE=your-encryption-passphrase \
VAULT_NAME=MyVault \
npx obsidian-sync-mcp
```

Omit `COUCHDB_PASSPHRASE` if you don't use E2E encryption in LiveSync.

**Or with Docker:**

```bash
docker run -p 8787:8787 \
  -v mcp-data:/data -e DATA_DIR=/data \
  -e VAULT_PATH=/vault -v ~/Documents/MyVault:/vault \
  -e VAULT_NAME=MyVault \
  ghcr.io/es617/obsidian-sync-mcp:latest
```

Your MCP endpoint is `http://localhost:8787/mcp`.

**Want remote access?** Add a tunnel (machine must stay on):

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8787    # free
tailscale funnel 8787                             # or Tailscale
ngrok http 8787                                   # or ngrok
```

Set `BASE_URL` to the tunnel URL when using authentication.

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `read_note` | Read a note's markdown content by path |
| `write_note` | Create or overwrite a note (replaces entire content) |
| `edit_note` | Edit a note without rewriting it — append, prepend (after frontmatter), or replace exact text |
| `list_folders` | List all folders in the vault with note counts — use to discover folder names |
| `list_tags` | List all tags in the vault with counts — use to discover tags before filtering |
| `list_notes` | List notes with timestamps. Filter by folder, name, tag, or date. Sort by name or modified. |
| `delete_note` | Delete a note |
| `move_note` | Move or rename a note — works across folders, creates destination folders automatically |
| `get_note_metadata` | Get frontmatter, tags, outgoing links, backlinks, size, and timestamps — navigate the knowledge graph |

Every tool response includes an [Obsidian deep link](https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/Obsidian+URI) (`obsidian://open?vault=...&file=...`) that works on Mac and iOS.

> "Add a bullet point to my daily note." "Find my notes about the MCP server and fix the typo in the second one."

---

## Authentication

Set `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` to a password to enable authentication:

```bash
MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=mysecretpassword npx obsidian-sync-mcp
```

The server includes a self-contained OAuth 2.1 provider. When an agent connects:

1. A browser window opens with a password page
2. Enter the `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` password
3. The agent gets an access token and refreshes it transparently

The session is shared across all your Claude interfaces (Desktop, Web, Mobile) and persists across server restarts. You'll need to re-enter the password after 14 days of inactivity (configurable via `MCP_REFRESH_DAYS`).

For non-OAuth clients (curl, MCP Inspector, custom agents), you can also pass the token directly as `Authorization: Bearer <MCP_AUTH_TOKEN>`.

Without `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`, the server runs without authentication — suitable for local use or behind a private network.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `VAULT_PATH` | Filesystem mode | — | Path to your Obsidian vault directory |
| `COUCHDB_URL` | CouchDB mode | — | CouchDB server URL |
| `COUCHDB_USER` | CouchDB mode | `admin` | CouchDB username |

| `READ_ONLY` | Optional | `false` | Set to `true` to disable all write tools (`write_note`, `edit_note`, `delete_note`, `move_note`). Only read tools are exposed via MCP. Useful when sharing the server with multiple AI clients and write access should be opt-in. |

Set `VAULT_PATH` for filesystem mode or `COUCHDB_URL` for CouchDB mode.

---

## Try without an agent

Test the server interactively using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector):

```bash
VAULT_PATH=~/Documents/MyVault npx obsidian-sync-mcp &
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

Set transport to **Streamable HTTP**, enter `http://localhost:8787/mcp`, and connect.

---

## How to update

| How you run it | How to update |
|---|---|
| `npx obsidian-sync-mcp` | Automatic — npx pulls latest |
| Fly.io | From the same directory where you ran setup: `fly deploy`. If you lost the fly.toml, run `fly config save --app your-app-name` to restore it. |
| Docker | `docker pull ghcr.io/es617/obsidian-sync-mcp:latest` and restart |

---

## Known limitations

- **Single vault per instance.** Each server connects to one vault. For multiple vaults, run multiple instances on different ports.
- **Single machine on Fly.io.** Auth state is in-memory, so multiple machines break the OAuth flow. The setup script enforces this automatically.
- **No conflict resolution.** If an agent and Obsidian edit the same note simultaneously, last write wins.
- **Text only.** Binary attachments are not exposed through MCP tools.
- **Deep links depend on the client.** Obsidian `obsidian://` deep links are included in every tool response. They work on Claude Mobile and in browsers, but some clients (Claude Desktop) may not render them as clickable links.
- **Node 22+ required.**
- **Setup script requires bash.** The `deploy/setup.sh` script works on macOS and Linux. On Windows, use WSL or Git Bash.

## Safety

This server gives an AI agent read/write access to your Obsidian vault.

**Agents can modify and delete notes.** Keep backups. Use tool approval deliberately.

**Authentication is optional.** Always set `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` when exposing to the internet.

**Use HTTPS in production.** Use a tunnel or deploy behind a reverse proxy.

This software is provided as-is under the [MIT license](https://github.com/es617/obsidian-sync-mcp/blob/main/LICENSE). You are responsible for what agents do with your vault.
